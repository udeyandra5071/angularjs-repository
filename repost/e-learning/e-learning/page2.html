<h2>Astrology and Diabetes Mellitus</h2>
<p>What a pity! For a man in old age, the body shrinks. He walks with faltering steps. The teeth have fallen. Vision is impaired. Deafness worsens. The mouth foams with saliva. Relatives do not care for his words. Wife does not do service and children turn inimical.</p>
<p>A man in the years of decline loses his faculties gradually. One cannot be hale and healthy throughout his life. The natural wear and tear of the system inevitably disables him. But one can take precautions and safeguard oneself against some of the common diseases by leading a disciplined life, dietary restrictions and measures that defend the system. Medical Astrology does help mankind in identifying diseases that are likely to occur and helps the native to take suitable measures before the infirmity assumes gigantic proportions. </p>
