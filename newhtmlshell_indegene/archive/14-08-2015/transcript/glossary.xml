   <title>Amantadine</title>
   <paragraph>One of 4 prescription medications (along with rimantadine, oseltamivir, and zanamivir) with antiviral activity against influenza viruses licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment and/or prevention of influenza. Controlled clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of all four antiviral medications in reducing symptom duration when used for treatment of influenza infections. However, all the drugs may not always work against different influenza virus strains because these can become resistant to one or more of these medicines. For example, analyses have shown that some of the H5N1 viruses isolated from poultry and humans in Southeast Asia are resistant to amantadine and rimantadine. </paragraph>
