<h2><p>Cleaner, healthier eating</p></h2>
<p>Healthy eating isn't always easy, especially with junk foods
tempting you at the grocery store, corner deli, and even the 
office kitchen. Though eating clean at every meal isn't always 
realistic, you can take steps to limit processed food.</p>

 to highly processed (apple toaster pastries). </p>
